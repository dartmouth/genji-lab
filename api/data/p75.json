    "text": "The Emperor in his wisdom had earlier sought out the opinion of a Japanese diviner, whose reading of the boy’s physiognomy accorded with his own thinking at the time. His Majesty had been holding back on installing the young Prince in the line of succession, and was thus impressed by the perspicacity of the Korean diviner, who recognized the boy’s imperial lineage. Even so, he could not be sure how long his own reign would last, and he hesitated to appoint his son prince-without-rank. He anxiously wondered whether the boy, who lacked support from his mother’s family, would not end up precariously adrift once he was no longer in the line of succession. For that reason he determined that the boy’s prospects might be better if he were made to serve as a loyal subject of the imperial court, and so he had his son tutored accordingly in the arts and in various fields of learning. The boy was so exceptionally bright it seemed a shame to demote him to commoner status, but the Emperor knew that designating his son heir apparent would invite the calumny and scorn of the court. He consulted yet another diviner who was wise in the ways of Indic astrology, and when this new reading proved to be in line with the others and with His Majesty’s own thoughts on the matter as well, he decided to confer on the boy the clan name of Minamoto⏤Genji⏤thereby making him a commoner.",
