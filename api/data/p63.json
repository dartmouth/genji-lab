    "text": "The Emperor took pity on the grandmother. “She told you how gratifying it was to be able to fulfill her late husband’s last request that their daughter serve at court. Now, judging from her poem, it seems she believes all her efforts have been in vain. She should not feel that way. Though her daughter may be gone, there will surely be occasions when I must do things for her grandson ... should the young Prince survive to manhood. She should thus be patient and live a long life in anticipation of his glorious future.”",
