    "text": "The Minister enjoyed the full confidence of the Emperor. After all, his principal wife, the mother of the bride, was His Majesty’s full sister. Thus, the bride came from a distinguished line on both sides of her family. Moreover, the addition of Genji to the Minister’s family diminished the prestige of his rival the Minister of the Right, who as grandfather of the Crown Prince would eventually assume power as Chancellor. The Minister of the Left had numerous children by several wives. His principal wife had given him, in addition to Genji’s bride, a son who was now Middle Captain in the Inner Palace Guard. This young man, Tō no Chūjō, was exceptionally handsome, and the Minister of the Right could hardly ignore such a promising prospect, even though he was not on good terms with the Minister of the Left, his main rival for power. He therefore arranged to marry the young Tō no Chūjō to his fourth daughter, who was his greatest treasure in the world. His regard for his son-in-law was every bit as strong as that given to Genji by the Minister of the Left. For their part, the two young men forged an ideal friendship.",
