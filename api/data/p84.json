    "text": "After the Emperor made this request, Genji, in his boyish emotions, would try everything⏤even references to the transient blossoms of spring or the blazing leaves of autumn⏤to gain Fujitsubo’s recognition of his yearning affection for her. When the Kokiden Consort learned of the unprecedented favoritism His Majesty was displaying toward these two, she once more grew cold and distant toward Fujitsubo and her retinue. Moreover, her earlier ominous dislike of Genji and his mother flared up again, and she found the boy repellent. Her son, the Crown Prince, was considered flawlessly handsome, and his reputation was above reproach. Nonetheless, he was no match for the lustrous beauty of Genji, who possessed an aura that prompted the courtiers to call him “the Radiant Prince.” Because Fujitsubo was his equal in looks and in the affections of the Emperor, she came to be referred to as “the Princess of the Radiant Sun.”",
