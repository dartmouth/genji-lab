## 💻 Developer Quick Start

### Goal: Run Genji locally in 10 minutes

#### Prerequisites

Install these if you don't have them:
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** ([Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))
- **Git** ([Download](https://git-scm.com/))

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository (1 minute)

```bash

```

✅ **Repository cloned!**

#### Step 2: Start with Docker Compose (2 minutes)

```bash
# Start all services (database, backend, frontend)
docker compose up
```

**What's happening:**
- PostgreSQL database starting on port 5432
- FastAPI backend starting on port 8000
- React frontend starting on port 5173
- First run takes 2-5 minutes (downloading images, building)

**Watch for:**
```
✓ Container rc-genji-db-1       Started
✓ Container rc-genji-api-1      Started
✓ Container rc-genji-ui-1       Started
```

✅ **All services running!**

#### Step 3: Access Genji (30 seconds)

Open your browser:

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **API Health**: http://localhost:8000/health

✅ **Genji is running!**

#### Step 4: Create Your First Admin User (2 minutes)

**Option A: Using the API directly**

1. Go to http://localhost:8000/docs
2. Find **POST /users/register**
3. Click **"Try it out"**
4. Fill in the JSON:
```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "admin123",
  "first_name": "Admin",
  "last_name": "User"
}
```
5. Click **"Execute"**
6. ✅ User created!

**Option B: Using the UI**

1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Click **"Register"**
3. Fill in the form
4. Click **"Create Account"**
5. ✅ User created!

**Make yourself an admin:**
```bash
# Connect to the database
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d genji

# Grant admin role (replace 'admin' with your username)
UPDATE users SET is_admin = true WHERE username = 'admin';

# Exit
\q
```

✅ **You're now an admin!**

#### Step 5: Verify Everything Works (2 minutes)

**Test checklist:**

1. ✅ Can you log in? (http://localhost:5173)
2. ✅ Can you access admin panel?
3. ✅ Can you create a classroom?
4. ✅ Can you see API docs? (http://localhost:8000/docs)
